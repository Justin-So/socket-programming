High Level Description: I created a server and a client that connect through a socket connection in Java. When the Server is created, it'll parse through a default dictionary or a provided dictionary. Once a client connects to the server, it'll create a thread and a new instance of the Hangman Game. The server selects a word and sends it over to the client as a packet. The client will then guess characters (bad guesses will be filtered out by the Client) and will continue until either the user guesses the word correctly or has 6 incorrect guesses, in which the user will lose. If a character is guessed correctly, the server will return a new message that shows where in the string the correct guess belongs and will continue to listen for a new guess.
